TandemBistro is a cooperative cooking game that supports cross-platform play between VR and PC users. The game focuses on teamwork, coordination, and time management in a virtual kitchen environment.

Most important libraries:
- XR Toolkit, setup of VR player and XR simulator
- Unity Netcode, setup of cross-platform online multiplayer
- Unity Relay, easier p2p connection
- ParrelSync, lets you open more than one instances of Unity for debugging in multiplayer

Game is functional, but needs further level design, difficulty wasn't set up yet. All API keys were revoked, connection in current network transport (Unity Relay) is not possible without connecting Unity Project and setting up Relay.
